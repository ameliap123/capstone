# Capstone

Our repository for our Senior Project class. This game is an RPG that teaches about nitrogen deposition and climate change. The main goal is for this game to be used in classrooms as supplemental teaching material, but will be available for any to use. All parts of gameplay that pertain to education and the conveyance of information will be based on real world statistical data collected by the Environmental Sciences Department at the University of Nevada, Reno, provided by our advisor Erin Hanan. This game will have 4 basic levels on a PC platform. Its functionality will include move view, increase water, increase nitrogen, save, load, and more to be determined as we continue development.

We currently have:
Level 1 Design, Camera Movement, In game Menu, Audio Design, Save Function, Main Menu

Winter adds:
Level 2-4 Designs, Interactable Items, Inventory System, Load Function

Spring Semester:
Sprite Movement/Invisible Walls, Leveling functionality/ratio reporting, Lore, Bug fixes
